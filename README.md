# Web-Based Objection Detection Application

# Introduction


# How to accesss and use the application!
To run the application in your own system.

Hardware Requiremnt:
1. Operating System: Microsoft Windows 10 (32 or 64-bit)
2. RAM: Minimum 4 GB
3. Disk Space: Minimum 16 GB to run PhpStorm code
4. Access to a web-cam

Software Requirement:
1. IDE: PhpStorm, which can be downloaded and set up from this link: https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/download/#section=windows
2. Node.js, which should be downloaded and configured with PhpStorm. This YouTube video link provides a step-by-step guide for the installation process: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYbfB7z9Ld0
3. Knowledge of the Tensorflow framework
4. Setup of the COCO-SSD model

# To play with the web application directly!
The static website has already been hosted using Github. Link to access the website is: https://milin2001.github.io/
Walk through the web application:
1. For best user experience it is advised to use desktop and run on Google chrome.
2. The first page is home page.
3. Using the navigation bar you can access the image based detection page or live detection page (which requires you to allow accesss to camera).
4. The website is user-friedly so just upload images or turn on the camera to see the magic!



# Risks and Challenges Associated with Web-based Object Detection Systems

1. Data protection and safeguarding against cyberattacks, unauthorized access, and data leaks.
2. Ensuring training data quality and variety to avoid biased or imprecise predictions.
3. Resource and storage requirements, which can be costly and reduce system effectiveness.
4. Prompt response times, crucial for real-time detection, which can be impeded by network constraints.
5. Resilience to environmental variables such as lighting, weather conditions, and obstructions.
6. Adversarial threats, including manipulation of input data to generate false detections, and ethical and legal concerns such as biases, discrimination, and privacy violations.

# Conclusion
 In conclusion, web-based object recognition systems offer significant benefits to various industries, but developers must address numerous risks and challenges to ensure their effective and secure deployment. These challenges include data protection and safeguarding, training data quality and variety, resource and storage requirements, prompt response times, resilience to environmental variables, adversarial threats, and ethical considerations. By addressing these challenges, developers can ensure the successful integration and widespread adoption of these systems.
